## Quick Start

Every API endpoint is consided of one `route` and one `action`.

1. Open the routes.ts file and add a new route to the list of entpoints, for example, if we want to build an endpoint to retrieve a single user information:

```js
import { Router } from 'express';
import { safe } from './utils';
import { getUser } from './actions';
const router = Router();


router.get('/user/:id', safe(getUser));
```

Note: please note that the `save` function must always be called before your action or the API errors will be silent

2. Open the `actions.ts` and add or re-use one of the action functions, for example:

```js
export const getUser = async (req: Request, res: Response): Promise<Response> =>{
	
	const users = await getRepository(Users).findOne(req.params.id);
	return res.json(users);
}
```


## Migrations (only for production environment)

1. Generate a new migration file after changes were made to the models:

```bash
$ typeorm migration:generate -n <pick_a_migration_name>
```

2. Run your all of your pending migrations:

```bash
$ typeorm migration:run
```



## PostgreSQL


This will give you an auto-starting PostgreSQL server (it should auto-start every time you open a new Terminal), plus a few utility scripts that you can run in a Terminal or in a .gitpod.yml command:

```
pg_start: start the PostgreSQL service
pg_stop: stop the PostgreSQL service
pg_ctl status: check if the PostgreSQL service is running
Once the PostgreSQL server is running, you can use the psql CLI as usual:

$ psql -h localhost -d postgres
psql (10.8 (Ubuntu 10.8-0ubuntu0.18.10.1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```
